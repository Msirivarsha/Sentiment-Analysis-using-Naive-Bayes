# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes
This is a Sentimental Analysis project where I am using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to analyze the sentiment of tweets. I have used entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. 

Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.

i am using twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_validation.csv as the validation set.

I've achieved a test accuracy of 94%.
